# Getting Started with Vaadin Core Elements

This page will guide you through the installation of the Vaadin Core Elements bundle and help you get started with your first project using these elements.

## Installation

There are three ways to use Vaadin Core Elements in your project: Bower, CDN, and a ZIP archive. The only difference between these options is the URL that you use to import the necessary files into your HTML page.

### Create a New Folder

Start by creating a new folder for your project and change to the folder.

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mkdir# [replaceable]#my-project#
[prompt]#$# [command]#cd# [replaceable]#my-project#
----

### Install Vaadin Core Elements

#### Bower

The recommended way to manage your front-end dependencies is to use link:http://bower.io[Bower]. Follow the link:http://bower.io/#install-bower[Bower installation instructions], then run the following command inside your project folder to install the most recent stable release.

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#bower# install --save [replaceable]#vaadin-core-elements#
----

This will download the Vaadin Core Elements bundle and its dependencies into the [filename]#bower_components# folder under your project's folder.

If you wish to use a development snapshot version of some element, you can install and update that separately. For example:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#bower# install --save [replaceable]#vaadin-grid##master
----

#### CDN

You can use Vaadin Core Elements from our link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network[CDN] server. This is especially convenient for services like JSFiddle, Codepen.io, etc.

For example, to import [vaadinelement]#vaadin-grid#, use the following URL:

----
<link href="https://cdn.vaadin.com/vaadin-core-elements/latest/vaadin-grid/vaadin-grid.html" rel="import">
----

To import all Vaadin Core Elements, use the following URL:

----
<link href="https://cdn.vaadin.com/vaadin-core-elements/latest/vaadin-core-elements/vaadin-core-elements.html" rel="import">
----

You can also use the nightly snapshot versions of any component, e.g.

----
<link href="https://cdn.vaadin.com/vaadin-core-elements/master/vaadin-grid/vaadin-grid.html" rel="import">
----

#### Download as a ZIP

1. Download the latest release ZIP archive from the link:https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-core-elements/releases[GitHub releases page]
2. Extract the archive under your project folder, for example in a [filename]#deps# folder.

### Create a HTML file

Create a new HTML file (for example [filename]#index.html#) inside your project folder and copy the code below into it.

Pay attention to the following details:

 - HTML5 doctype [elementname]#!doctype html# is required for everything to work smoothly.
 - You need to adjust how the [filename]#webcomponents-lite.min.js# polyfill and [filename]#vaadin-core-elements.html# are imported according to the installation option you selected.
 - Notice how the JavaScript logic waits for [classname]#WebComponentsReady# event before accessing the elements.


**Serving the files during development**, when using Bower or the ZIP archive:

Due to browser security restrictions, serving HTML imports from a `file:///` URL does not work. You need a web server to view pages where you use custom elements. One simple option is to use the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve["serve" npm package].

       <col name="firstName">

       <col name="email">

       <!-- Define the column headings. -->
       <thead>
         <tr>
           <th>First Name</th>
           <th>Last Name</th>
           <th>Email</th>
         </tr>
       </thead>
     </table>
   </vaadin-grid>

   <script>
     // The Web Components polyfill introduces a custom event we can
     // use to determine when the custom elements are ready to be used.
     document.addEventListener("WebComponentsReady", function () {

       // Reference to the grid element.
       var grid = document.querySelector("vaadin-grid");

       // Add some example data as an array.
       grid.items = [
         { "firstName": "Hugo", "lastName": "Romero", "email": "hugo.romero@example.com" },
         { "firstName": "Nieves", "lastName": "Diez", "email": "nieves.diez@example.com" },
         { "firstName": "Esteban", "lastName": "Vega", "email": "esteban.vega@example.com" },
         { "firstName": "Roxane", "lastName": "Diez", "email": "roxane.diez@example.com" }
       ];
     });
   </script>

 </body>
</html>

After you have created the file and you have a local server serving the files, you should be able to open up the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000/index.html (notice that the port number may vary depending on the server you use).
