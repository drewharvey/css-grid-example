<h1>Repositioning Elements with CSS Grid Layout</h1>

<p>
    Normally if we wanted to reposition an element we would use Javascript to manipulate the 
    DOM structure, removing and re-injecting the target element where ever we want it.
    With CSS grid, we can simply use CSS to tell the grid where elements should be positioned.  
    We can label sections of the grid (grid-area) and then tell elements what grid-area they 
    should be in.  This can be especially useful when elements must be repositioned based on the
    display/device size.
<p>
    Let's say we want to make an email web application.  
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>header</li>
        <li>navigation</li>
        <li>email list</li>
        <li>preview panel</li>
        <li>footer</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    Now we can layout our basic elements in the DOM. Anyone looking at this could easily see what the 
    different parts of the UI are.
</p>

<p>
    Next we need to figure out how to display these sections on different screen sizes. For this example lets focus on 
    small, medium, and large size screens.
</p>

<img alt="" src="/documents/411367/0/css-grid-elements.jpg/f106b6b6-8270-4f94-98be-e870a8758c4f?t=1502746410246" />

<p>
    We need to draw a grid that will encapsulate all of the sections of the UI. Below you can see the 
    grid traced by the thick black lines.  The text inside each grid cell is the "grid-area" name. This
    name is how we can refer to sections of the grid.  A grid-area can take up multiple cells.
</p>

<p>
    Look at the medium display example.  Notice how there are two cells that are labeled "header".
    This is because our header grid-area takes up both of those cells.  The grid-area defines and names a portion of
    the grid.  By having this, we can simply use CSS tell the <pre><header></pre> element to be placed in the "header" grid-area.
    We could even tell the <pre><header></pre> element to be positioned in the "footer" grid-area and you would see your
    <pre><header></pre> element at the bottom!  This is handy because it means we can change the ordering and position and size of our html 
    elements with just a single css rule!
</p>
<p>
    The CSS code almost looks identical to our visual image.  Using the grid-template-areas CSS rule, we can
    define our grid-areas and where what cells they belong to.  Below we see the visual layout right next to
    the CSS.
</p>

<p>
   A common use case is to move, scale, or reposition elements on different screen sizes.  We can use media queries
   and the grid-template-areas css attribute to set the grid-area size and positions. For this application
   we want the navigation to be at the top on small displays, but on larger displays it should be on the side.
   We also want the preview panel to display next to the email list on wider displays. 
   We can easily make this position by rearranging the grid-areas using the grid-template-areas CSS rule.
</p>
<p>
    Define the grid areas and how they are positioned in CSS:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/drewharvey/22a34f7eb4d89d9c9d19321d58833e0a.js?file=grid-areas.css"></script>

<p>
    Now that we have defined how we want the grid-areas to be positioned, we need to associate our page
    elements with specific grid-areas.  An element can specify 'grid-area' and the name of the grid-area. 
    This will place the element into that grid-area in the layout.

    Note that in this example most of the element names are the same as the grid-area name. This is
    not required and is just to simplify the example.
</p>

<p>
    One thing you'll notice if you use the code above, is that the heights and widths of the grid are not
    how we want them.  We need to specify the height for each row, and the width for each column.  
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Row height is specified using the grid-template-rows CSS rule</li>
    <li>Column width is specified using the grid-template-rows CSS rule</li>
</ul>
